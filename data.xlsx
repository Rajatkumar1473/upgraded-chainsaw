Idea	Topic
"The idea is to create a ticketing support system wherein customer can log inquiry, concerns and support needed. Support system may include chat support for real-time customer experience.

This type of system can help the company to track each ticket raised by support team (from chat facility)/direct from customer, with this functionality company can trace easily which customer requires higher attention based on the issue logged in the system.

Notes can be added easily within the customer record to help all the people within Boots to have same/sync information.

Automatic alerts for concerns or ticket that have been long standing can also be added so full attention from the management be allocated which can avoid irate clients/customer.

MS Dynamics CRM Case Management represent a single incident of support, some companies may refer to a case as a ticket, service request etc. Each customer can have multiple cases at any moment in time. Cases have subjects, knowledge base articles, products and / or entitlements related to them. Cases also have activities associated with them. And cases can originate from activities, such as an email support query.Cases can be created from the case form, a quick create form or by converting activities. (Activities can include, appointments, emails, phone calls, faxes, letters, service activities, campaign responses, tasks and even custom activities.) It is also possible to use record creation rules to automate creation of cases, for example on receipt of an email.


Cases, by default, utilise a business process flow to display stage information. The default stages are identity, research and resolve."	NA

"Prioritize the tickets and as and when the tickets are raised by the Clients in the system, trigger an Email to the Boots Support team. A scheduler can be configured and automated which would invoke the ticketing system periodically and sends out an Email with high priority with the ticket details logged by the Client. As soon as the email is received, the tickets could be addressed by the Boots Support team. 
This will help in saving lot of time as the current solution needs to tweek into the system manually for checking the tickets. Whereas the new solution would save time and lessen the burden to verify the system manually for the tickets. Additionally, the tickets would be addressed on time without any delay."	NA
"Any unplanned interruption to the quality of services can be termed as an incident which can eventually lead to  
the threat of a service . And hence crucial acknowledgment of any incident reported on priority basis should be  
our primary focus . To effectively handle incidnets it is always good to primarily focus on  
Restoring the service ASAP rather than spending more time on RCA (Root cause Analysis) .  
 Below key points is all about bringing in new strategies for improvising the current Issue management system   
1. Inorder to bring in a temporary fix as mentioned above it is important tomaintain aKnown error database (KEDB)  
Where we actually maintain a database which has the history of problems encountered in the past .It is infact  
a repository of information for the IT system. User can rely on the KEDB for any issues and can seek help to  
come up with a temp fix for the issue similar to a search engine. We typically say ""Just google and see"" which is a major  
SE we currently have for anything and everything.
2.Maintaining a cloud solution tool/Platform  for incidents (An App / Webased solution) where we actually maintain informations on
1.Response Plan  a.steps to handle the incident    b.Resolution and timeframe for completion          c.Escalation procedure for SLA breach
2.Response Management  -Creation of schedule and Tasks
3.Monitoring- Generates dashboard and PDF reports for the incident
This is how we can bring in digitization for ticket handling .  
3.Adoption of Divide and conquor alogorithm- Incident can occur due to interruption of many engaging systems and
breaking down a problem into subproblems would help us achieve faster resolution for the incident and multiple groups
who works on subproblems can be more effective.      
4.Managing a team who can take an end to end responsibility of managing and assigning incidents can be done .This will  
ensure that incidents are being worked by the concerned team and hence they retains the ownership and responsibility  
for monitoring the life of the ticket regardless of which service  group is  are currently managing the ticket.  
This also allows to raise appropriate escalations, make updates in a timely manner  
and monitor the ticket status (Assigned/Resolved/Closed/Deferred etc ).

"1.Build a customer service app for mobile / Boots Kiosk that can take in customer query as a message  and create a ticket for it. Leverage unified messaging to capture requests from multiple channels such as sms,email etc.)
2. Have a drop down list  to enable customer select the issue type to see if this is a frequent /common  problem or query that can be resolved immediately and preferably through automatic replies.  
3. Have online / Live Chat integrated so that customer can have their issues resolved in real time and also feel more connected. Bots can initiate conversations and respond to standard / FAQ responses and customer service agent can respond to other queries. 
4. Based on analytics (of past issues, historical responses , feedback and  current requests) a prioritization matrix to assign priority to tickets can be determined.
5. Apply prioritization on the ticket - High, Medium, Low and customer support reps to be measured on not just the number of tickets but based on number of priority tickets closed ( a weighted arithmetic to be used).
6. Have a visual dashboard to measure time to closure and wait times between tickets. This will help improve efficiency by deploying an optimal sized team.
7. Develop wiki style portals so that responses and FAQs are accurately updated and kept current for consistent messaging when responding to customers."	NA

"Based on the problem description and the issues faced, below is what I would do:


- Helpdesk : Put an effective helpdesk from UST that seperates tickets into different teams and assigns ticket to the respective team lead. This specially helps in an environment where ticket volume is high. 

- Zendesk : Look at this ticketing tool option. UST can use it. There are lot of times where updates to tickets stays untonoticed and mailers gets lost in volume.  Zendesk is the best ticketing tool I have come across ever in my 11 yrs of professional experience.

- Team Mailbox - Use 1 single team mailbox instead of individual mailbox and tag tickets as per type. If issues are high, issues gets lost on the queue and hence the idea of a common queue.

"1. Automated ticketing agent (chatbot) is able to read keywords or catchphrases and automatically create tickets on behalf of the customer.
2. For instance user just types ""packaging issue"", the chatbot captures that the customer/supplier has an issue with the delivered goods and poses a response back "" We understand there is a packing issue for the goods already delivered, If so, please say Yes"". Once it is confirmed, the ticket is raised on behalf of the customer and assigned to the packaging team. Input is captured in terms of reading/scanning the barcode of the packaged goods.
3. If internal/external user types ""New cash machine"", it understands that the store needs a new cash machine to be installed. So it posts a reply back confirming the intent, opens a ticket and sends to the manager for approval.
4. This can be done within a smartphone app, it has been implemented in some organizations.
5. To order new stocks/replenish stock, they could go with tabs or buttons similar to Amazon Dash buttons. It is a wi-fi enabled cloud device that is used to order frequently used items. It could be slightly enhanced to read a product key and order the new number of items needed."	NA

"Every Issue could be segregated into various sub-groups. This could be based on the subsystem, domain or technology. Our idea basically implements the grouping of the ticket issues to handle them better. Each grouping issues are then documented based on the recurring problem. Then resolve the problem by tackling the root-cause.
[1] First consider an ideal tool to handle the Incident Management considering the ITIL framework Eg: HP solutions
[2] At the service desk Level 1 when the incident arrives group them into different sub-groups and redirect accordingly.
[3] Service desk level 2 is specific to sub-groups, that will handle requests , refer to documentation and try resoving the issue. They prepare not-available KB documents on the incident. Not available KB and unresolved issues go into Level 3 of sub-group
[4] Service desk Level 3 will try to resolve more of a data and environment issue acting like a production support team and helping the steps to Level 2 for preparing the KB on the incident. They create problem ticket on recurring incidents to resolve with root-cause identified.
[5] Further Sevice Level 3 will cut down the task to the Level 4 development team on code issues.


The above segregation into sub-groups combined with delegation to other levels and accurate documentation is a way to handle efficiently

"Problem Scenario.
 When a system performing a critical business function fails (due to system failures etc) , within a very short span of time multiple tickets for the same incident are created.  This causes overhead for the L1 support as the requestors have to be informed about workarounds, ETAs, resolutions, etc, which is redundant in nature.  Most Incident management vendors have provisions which enables L1 team to create master ticket which can be linked to supplementary tickets. If the impact is huge, the L1 team configures IVRs with the master ticket details so that the customers are informed about the failure(when they call the customer care numbers). Users need to refer only to the master ticket to get the most recent updates, workarounds, resolutions etc about the incident.
The process of creating the master ticket, configuring IVR etc is most often manual and hence, by the time L1 sets up the IVR, there would be multiple tickets in the system.
Idea
 The idea is to automate the creation of the master ticket and its linking it to the IVR by Robotic Process Automation, thereby reducing customer dissatisfaction, minimizing the L1 effort etc. This idea is more suited for failures where impact is huge and the resolution is time critical.
Steps for implementation
1. Through RPA, various business service applications/functions are polled regularly for service availability.
 2. If a service isnt available, tickets with the appropriate priority level is created by the incident management system, using their corresponding incident triggering mechanism
 3. The auto generated tickets are routed from the L1 to the corresponding L2/L3 support (this can be automated/supervised based on client requirements).
 4. If the estimated impact is huge, the incident management software will then trigger a search for a matching IVR template,(if not L1 has to create a new one) from the IVR template repository.
 5. Once the IVR is setup by the L1, any new customer wanting to raise a ticket for the same incident will be informed about the failure and will be provided with the reference to master ticket.
 6. If Customers, wish to get a push notification about the workaround or resolution, the IVR can accept the needed contact info, which will be updated to the intimation list associated with the ticket.
 7. Customers will be intimated in a single shot by the incident management software, based on the appropriate status changes for ticket. This frees up valuable L1 support time and improves customer satisfaction."	NA
"This is basically a workflow/taskflow based system built in Oracle ADF where it queries past history for the issues and solutions, and an email notification process bounded by SLAs.  The system ensures the problem is resolved or intimated to the respected POC along with the escalation matrix.

Approaches can be as follows,

1. List box that categorizes the problem type

2. Each category will have the solution roadmap handed over to the client.

3. If the problem type is new, it would be taken to the escalation matrix with action plan and SLAs set, hence the resolution time is intact without a millisecond slip.

4. The new problem type would be added to the existing category and the loop repeats.


The solution can be implemented through Oracle ADF [UI Design], Workflow or inbuilt Taskflows to device the flow mechanism, UMS [User Messaging Service] to trigger the emails to the respective POC with escalation matrix in the loop.
5. Audit report can be pulled to know the Pie chart or bar chart representations of issues and resolution for the predictive analysis.

"The idea is to have an Intelligent Chatbot that interacts with the customer ,understands the issues and provide resolution steps based on the historic ticket details.Given below are the benefits of Smart Remediator.

Reduced Ticket Inflow: It will either direct the customer to Self Service Catalogs  or provide steps to resolve by themselves based on previous historic information.This reduces the ticket inflow and customer's time is also not wasted in creating tickets.

Automatic Ticket creation:It  can also create tickets automatically by interacting with Service Now whenever a new/different issue is identified.The customer and Service desk team will be notified on ticket details instantly.
Eliminates Duplicate tickets: In case a common issue/breakdown has occured, the system will proactively respond to the customer stating that it is being worked on or give appropriate responses.This avoids duplicate tickets being raised as the system reviews and provides smart resolutions.

Problem statement:
The situation badly demands a new improved and an efficient approach in place. As we can clearly see, raising ticket is hustle free for a customer but the resolution time is a great distress and this part runs under 'red' mark now unfortunately.
 Though while looking for improvements without considering the team perception would be a costly miss. Henceforth we got to complement 2 further grey areas additionally in this matter.
           1. Spike in incident numbers also a worry as this results into anunmanageable count with the offered resources.
           2. Need to make sure all the support engineers shares aclear understanding of the system they are handling on[Atleast the possible combinations of errors and concerns]


So in a perfect world scenario, we’re aiming and addressing for below Key measures.

 
a. Time saving. [Minimising the ticket resolution time]

b. Efficient (least steps)

c. Minimal/No manual errors
    


Solution Trivia
All mentioned below actions would enable team to deliver a much improved results.
  
1. Increase the efficiency of whole team starting from Service desk level. And end up in a much improved ticket resolution time as this training would result in minimal surprises as team is all equipped with the possible challenges. [Idea is to equip the team with a competitive knowledge of the things [here product/Services] that they work on]
2. Read and understand the history of incidents using improved analytics and understand the pattern they follow with respect to reach categories [Need to segregate all key incidents]. Idea is using the pattern of incident flow, we can understand which part is causing much trouble and we can apply some measures to limit those first.
3. And try not just to resolve the cases. But also focus more on limit the cases which all are possible. [E.g. Ambiguity of products/ services offered.]Idea is Even if we can spend a 5 time at the time of service offered will be a great gain compared to the time spent on resolving an issue later on.]
4. Compare the 'wins and gains' as we progress. Which would enable us to track the rpogress and make sure the measures are working as expected.


Addition to above, any measures which are taken without taking the Support engineer wont be handy and advicable.
Hence below add-on's also plays an x-factor here.
5. Employee lag on responce should control to minimal.
   E.g. Employee recognition plays a vital key in support so need to comply this on a monthly basis atleast. But measures should have no comprise on the quality of service delivered. 
6. Log entry need to optimise in the support tool what ever is used.
 Such that Support Engineer shouldn't spend much time on log creation such as [Time elapsed, Seviority, Next level Allocated person than a group etc.]
So while schosing the tool to work on Entry of log details captured should treat as a Key Indicator.

"      In this digitalization world customers/users from their previous experience/impatced user of the similar kind of issue or problem must be in a position to suggest or solve the issue of similar kind for another customer through some app. In return customer/user whom ever is solving/suggesting the problem of another customer should be rewarded appropriately so that many customers who have faced similar issue will move forward to solve the problmes in numbers.



     Hence this will make company to use their existing staff in routing the issues to relevant customer to solve and if it is new type of complaint then this can be handled by superiors team from the company.



    In my opinion people always wants to know something in reality from some reviews or comments to believe something told by sales person for solving their problems, so instead making people to wait for someone to comment or review we can directly let customers interact with eachother and in return they can be rewarded.


    So create an app to handle complaints and send notifictaion to customers who have already faced similar issue for solving or suggesting :).

The mobile App will give the option to acknowledge the ticket even when not in front of the system. Acknowledgement time is improved.
The person can reach in front of system to work on it. Incase the ticket is not with right group/team, he can reassign the ticket through the mobile app, which will improve the time to take action on the system.
The app should also provide alerts on the ticket which are going to miss the SLA , so that the assignee can work on the ticket at the earliest without missing SLA on any ticket.

Users (clients) will raise a concern thru text/email containing commonly used words (e.g. unable to access site SITE1). The system will parse the text/email and categorize/filter the concern accordingly. The system will then find a resolution by looking up on a data bank or repository containing saved mapping of keywords of common issues/concerns and corresponding resolution. If the information given by the client is not enough in order to look up for a particular resolution, the application can reply with a form that the client can fill out. The form from the client will be processed again.   
   
Once the keyword is found, the application can send an automatic reply containing the resolution or updates for system issues (eg. Application or database is down). A program from a Robotic process automation (RPA) software can also be executed. This robotic software will perform a specific task that will resolve the issue (eg. reset an account or call a service from another application and raise a ticket accordingly). This is only applicable for issues having a predictable resolutions.  
   
Otherwise, if the keyword is not found or the resolution provided is not enough, the application can redirect it to the admin support team. The admin support team can provide a resolution as the usual way. Once they are done, they can manually add the unique keyword to the data bank or link it to other keyword so the next time the system will encounter it, it won’t be redirected to the support team.  
   
This way, the support team can now eliminate or minimize answering/resolving same issues and can focus more in achieving work with greater productivity. A client can also expect an immediate response (coming from the system) to his concern as opposed to waiting for the support team to respond.

"The IT function needs to be managed in the same way business is, having its own value chain, processes, and information systems. Implementing IT4IT Reference Architecture (Open Group), refers to all the capabilities you need to manage IT services throughout its entire lifecycle. Just like the business uses IT to support or automate its business processes, the IT organization has to use IT to support and automate IT management processes. This includes information systems such as a Project Portfolio Management (PPM) system, development and testing tools, a Configuration Management Database (CMDB), or an IT Service Management (ITSM) system for managing incidents, problems, and changes. All these IT management tools represent “IT for the IT organization”, therefore referred to as IT4IT. The IT organization is becoming more dependent upon these information systems to automate IT management activities such as build, test, deploy, monitor, and perform automated recovery. Due to the growing importance of IT management to demonstrate the value of IT, but also due to its increase in complexity, there is need to acquire new skills and competences within the IT organization to deliver these integrated IT4IT solutions.

Despite the availability of many best practices, frameworks, and standards for managing IT, enterprises often suffer from poor services and high costs and risks due to a silo’ed IT function with badly integrated IT management tools. The Open Group IT4IT Reference Architecture standard with its value chain-based IT operating model address this problem by providing a prescriptive and detailed information model-based framework that enhances and supports traditional process-based frameworks and standards. The IT4IT Reference Architecture was created because there is a need for a holistic, concise, and structured standard of how IT should be managed to provide maximum value for the business (managing IT as a business) based upon the IT Value Chain.

The IT4IT Reference Architecture enables a more streamlined, transparent, and automated IT function across the entire IT value chain.

1. Auto classification and work flow (ticket routing) will be done to route the ticket to the right team at the earliest
2. Handbook suggestions will provide the information to customer service executive , this will help resolve obvious issues and for others which need technical team support. The customer service person will be able to give directions to the end user on where there issue is being taken forward. this will help better end user satisfaction
3. Predictability and analytics


The system will need a repository of existing tickets and a job to update the repository on a daily basis.
The system can provide analytics capability as well, so that we can predict the issues that customer face and come up with proactive solutions."	NA

Since the problem statement mentions that Boots UK has to resolve a lot of issues on a daily basis, the solution could be to first look for commonly occuring incidents and identify any patterns of such issues. If so, some permanent fix could be incorporated to address such kind of issues in general. This should definitely reduce the incidents count upto some extent.


Then, there should be a new artificial intelligence based customer support platform, which should be very user friendly (eg. it could be in the form of a chatbot). It could work in this fashion :-
1) Once the user gives the nature of their problem, the chatbot should search for all possible solutions from it's knowledge database. If there are any straighforward solutions found, the bot could suggest the user to try that or if it's something like resetting of password for a user profile etc., the bot could perform that for the user.
The bot could ask for more information from the user in order to better look for a solution if it exists or not.


2) If the issue raised by the customer is something new and the bot cannot trace anything related to that in stored memory, it could gather all the details from the user (here some specific deep learning algorithms would be required to adapt to asking valid and specific questions from the users). Then with all such details, the chatbot could create a ticket and assign it to the next level support team (which could do further analysis and may do data or code fixes). Once the next level team fixes the issue, the chatbot would update its knowledge database with all the steps done etc. to fix that issue so that in future it could help out the users."	NA

Information  system
Ticket Database- We will create a ticket database that will contain the generated ticket information and the solution of that ticket. Our moto is to make our system automatic Means Before generating any new ticket first our system will take help of this database and find the possible solution.
Information System- If for any particular problem our automatic system will not get the solution then with the help of Information system the system will get the solution.

Short Description About Machine Learning Framework- The main moto of this solution is to make the system automate. And for this we will created two data base- ticket & information.
For any  repetitive problem our system will be feasible to give the solution  without generating the ticket.
  And if any problem is new then that will create a ticket and put the  details in the Ticket database. So that for further any repetitive  problem can be resolved without generating new ticket.

"As per my understanding ‘Landmark Ltd’ is having the contaminated land registered entries and notice discharge consents.
Let us first discuss, what are all the improvements can be done to tackle the flood in more safety and effective way to the people?
The major issues what people facing during flood times are they don’t have the clear information about the flood (NOTE: they will have the knowledge of the flood but with very low level of information).     

My Idea:
In our flood related data, as first step I will concentrate in contaminated land registered entries (the list of all water bodies present around us).
Let us consider a specific region,
So as per the above data I will have the list of all water bodies around me (such as ponds, rivers, dams, etc.)
So here we need to have a hardware configuration setup where I need to know the up to date data about the increase and decrease in the water levels (accurately) (NOTE: we have few measurement scales in dams but fail to have it in small water bodies) . 
So once I got the data about increase and decrease in the water bodies here we need to setup a software analytical tool to analyze the following information’s,
•	With having data, the tool need to analyze and match the water level change with the circumference/overflow possibilities.
•	Also using software analytics we need to predict where at first the water will overflow, which the major reason for flood is.
•	All the below will be reaching to the people by telecommunication service providers/ GPS based app.
•	Once when the analytical tool analyses the future flood warning or water bodies nearby going to overflow then the information first passed from analytical tool to service provider and based on the GEO using towers they will find the mobile phones over the alert area.
•	For that mobile numbers immediate information with entire details needs to be passed to the people through call/message with mentioning safe zones as well.
•	More detailed information’s can be provided for the app users using web.
This idea majorly based on the small water bodies which will not be covered as part of any media.     
(Note: this idea has been provided based on the insufficient facility on the real flood time for me during Chennai flood, where suddenly water surrounded us because we don’t have the information that the lake/pond is going to be broken).

This tool enhancement can be extended to call emergency rescue teams, to find the exact location of where people affected by flood way, also since we have the overflow path details as well, so that we can able to plan how to evacuate water in an effective way."	NA

"In order to improve the nutritional content by reducing the sodium and sugar content increasing the potassium and natural sugar content ,the regular sugar should be replaced with either palm sugar or coconut sugar which are having more health benefits.
The products which are consuming by the people should be tracked by themselves through mobile app or websites in the cloud computing method. One of the simplest way is that every customer can have the separate ID and password and the page should have all the Mars products and corresponding other products so that customer can easily add the item which they are purchasing in their profile and the system defined nutritional chart computations displays mapping to the product and overall calories value will be known to them which are easy way to compare the calories on different product."

"We can improvise on the ASDA Recipe Builder prototype + Merck Wellness Engagement App. one sample use case

Jane/John: Have the MarsEngage, which helps them with Mars recipe recommendations and nutrition tips in the shape of actual dishes/recipes they can use to enhance their health and minimize the impact on their conditions. 

1. From the very start we want to avoid obstacles and distractions to this goal by having a simple search ( voice enabled, Alexa, Google Home interface as well) 

Keywords on this search can
be health conditions, medications, or ingredients related to a condition or recipes based on Mars products ( Dolmio, wrigley's, chocolate bars :-)).. 
 
2. When the information is added, the system will automatically serve the user with recipes. We use 'food' because this is a basic communication
cue that relates to a natural sense. The app isn't selling anything. It is helping users. 

3. Infused in the focal point 'the recipe' there is additional/supportive information for discovery such as: Mars Products (free samples) and  nutrition information
. 
4. The actionable triggers are: Family/Mothers can discover free recipes and find a way to get them, 
and the users can share this info with other family members

Goals: 
a. Achieve a friendly relationship with Mars where users find help in plain terms ( Think Dolmio's innovative ad encouraging quality family time).
b. Create a different appreciation for the Mars brand--as a health/wellness brand

Phase 2 :: Connect Mars with Walmart/ASDA/ Boots/ Walgreens and also with MerckEngage platforms. It is not a Zero sum game. Every one wins ( Supplier/Mfr/ retailer/ consumer)

Model prototype on which to develop- we can include chatbots/ data analytics/ Machine Intelligence etc.

"Games are the easiest way to influence conscious and subconscious mind of individuals. Most of the packed food purchases that we make are intuitive or based on the attractiveness of the package.
If this needs to be controlled, it needs to be controlled at the subconscious level which will influence the buying behavior. Eg: Due to the hue inflow of messages on social media parents started believing that carbonated drinks are bad for the kids and not be used regularly.
The idea is to induce this influence through gamification. The gamewill have an Avatar as the main character and the objective of the game is to keep the avatar healthy by feeding MARS food products.
The game can have events wherein the avatar will host parties at home or celebrate birthdays and holidays.
On all these events the player can choose the food products from the MARS range based on the nutrients. A wrong choice will give warnings but if you forcefully engage a wrong food, the avatar will fall sick and will have a recovery time.
To indicate the health, the visual of the avatar will be more happy or sad giving timely warnings.
MARS products can be also advertised in the background subliminally so that pop up ads can be removed. 
Upon achieving a particular health score the player can redeem the points for MARS products at that point of time or can accumulate the scores to redeem against a high value product.
Over a period of time this will influence the buying pattern of the customer.

The game should be promoted in all outlets near the MARS counters through a QR code by which the game can be downloaded"	NA
"The proposed solution is a digital platform build using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Mars to address every aspect of their business. This platform can be applied through mobile application, Amazon Alexa, Google Home etc. The application would be a direct channel linking the Mars with their vendors and consumers. This would also be a one stop solution for Mars consumers to lead a healthier lifestyle.

A MarsBytes user can ask the AI – NLP system anything under the Mars Inc eco-system, let that be from their product range, food safety measures, diet plans, health tips and even about their Cacao Genome Project the system will respond promptly. These messages would be contextual to the application user preferences and location. 

Most of the people are health conscious and they do engage in strict diet plans or physical activities. These diet plans would be self-designed or being tips shared by friends. But, such diets could be dangerous and inappropriate for the user as per their health conditions. Using MarsBytes, each user will get a dedicated diet plan as per their requirement. The user can set the preferences and allergic items and based on that the diet chart will be prepared. The system will also suggest recipes based on your preference and keep track of your food consumptions.

MarsBytes can also be synced with healthcare wearables or fitness bands, smart watches to track the physical activity of the user. And based on these metrics the system will provide the user with a diet plan accordingly and calorie/fat burn charts.

We are have incorporated as symptom checker, where the user can ask questions on any symptoms (e.g. pain in legs) and based on that the treatment details will be provided. This would be an extension of what we already have in WebMD. Also Mars in association with telemedicine providers like WebMD, MDLIVE, Walgreens etc. could provide feature to book a doctor appointment. A pill tracker would be an added advantage in this aspect.

Form the vendor perspective, the vendor could place order for the Mars product and they can track it using MarsBytes. Since these orders are placed based on requirements Marc Inc. could save some dollars on transportation and logistics."	NA
"I felt that the perfect solution for any problem will be obtained from the thinking in the perspective of end user.
As per the mindset of end user in the retail industry, we need to understand few core principles to attract end user (customer),

•	Cost effective.
•	Quality product.
•	Comparatively higher product value in the market.
•	Easy accessible.
•	Best marketing strategy.


Most of our current methodologies and business strategy are concentrating mostly for making the customer feeling comfortable on the above mentioned points.
But I felt that the current market is lagging in creating an effective point of contact or a web to easily hit the customer.

MY IDEA IS:

Concentrating one level above the customers in the marketing chain (that is shopkeepers/seller who are having direct interaction with customer) is an effective way to overcome all the business ambitions of the company.
Creating a direct communication web between the following will bring a huge turning point in the current marketing strategy.
Company & shopkeepers/seller
Shopkeepers/seller & shopkeepers/seller
Shopkeepers/seller & customer
(NOTE: Shopkeepers/seller only one level above customer).
If a company can successfully able to link directly to customer through only one level of shopkeepers/seller it will be a huge success.

This will give a worldwide idea to innovate new flavors, new products, new ideas what customers expecting from company.

HOW:

Creating a platform for small shop keeper to directly link with the company, other peer shop keepers and customers.
 Where all the existing stock are maintained by the company using reliable software methodology.

eg:

The shopkeeper is in our link so that the company knows what the current quantity of product he is having is.
Two shopkeeper are in link so that they both will come to know the existing goods of their business peers and can able to exchange products in demand supply concept.
And we also can visualize the availability of the product to the customer as well.
This is a very effective technique because MARS owns more eatables which are still buy-able in direct shops than online market in current society.
Technical view:
Creating an online portal as well as apps to make company directly communicate with shopkeeper/seller which will be updated on real time (can hit remote people).
The same apps or online portals to view by the customer (can hit modern people).

(Note: the major point to note here is there will be lots of ideas to create an app or portal, but what I’m concentrating is creating a web to hit customer through only one level of merchant also the company will have the full control of stocks).

PROS:
•	The major response will be from shopkeeper to buy the products from company because he will get the products for most minimum price in the market.
•	Since there is a tool with the company to track the stock of each shopkeeper, we can easily understand the problems of the shopkeeper and demand supply of product without any delay.
•	The peer shopkeeper can communicate with each other’s to exchange the products based on demand bases.
•	The end user will also get known of what is the nearest shop with available stock.
•	All the announcements and messages can be conveyed through this web.
•	Once if this tool is hit, we can use this web to market other company goods as well.
•	This methodology can hit remote as well as online purchasers as well.

SHOPKEEPER/CUSTOMER ATTRACTION:
This can be done using the new brand name with the new attractive ads like how the leading network provider in India currently doing.
Providing attractive joining offers.
Giving offers in continued manner.

"This is associated with Ambition #1 in the Ideathon guidelines (Making food products more nutritious). 

Problem: 
If Mars Inc. wants to revamp their existing product assortment by replacing some of the products with more nutritious alternatives, it could be a gradual, slow process. This is because it involves a lot of renegotiations with vendors, decision making, marketing research and associated red tape. 

Recommendation: 
Rather than putting effort in replacing the existing product line with nutritious products, Mars can think of starting a home brand of food products, which contains groceries farmed by themselves. They can use food computers on a large scale for this. There will be an initial investment in this. But eventually, they will have a new brand which contains only the products farmed using food computers (vegetables, fruits) and the products made by them(salads etc.). Since the farming process can be fully controlled by IOT, it can be assured that the farming provides good results without having to apply pesticides etc.

"Excessive use of unhealthy ingredients contents in the food products of Mars can create health issues to consumers like obesity, diabetes and other health related ailments. Also, the high contents of such ingredients can attract tax from various Govt regulations (like sugar tax, public health product tax, ingredient based taxes etc). In order to attract more loyal customers to buy their food products and also reduce their burden on ingredients taxes, Mars would need to manufacture their products by making use of healthy alternatives ingredients approved by health organizations and other institutes putting compliance on processed foods. 

The idea is primarily to create an application that can provide some valuable insights to food specialists in Mars for aiding changes to nutrient contents and introduce better healthy alternatives. One module of the application should be capable to collect, analyze and process the information from various health org sites / FDA and create the database for alternative health ingredients. Most of these documents are in the form of unstructured text. Hence, automated text processing techniques using Natural language processing can be used to process these unstructured data and come up with meaningful data required for food processing. Various ingredient details required for food categories needed for Mars like nutrition facts, compliance facts, allergic nature, safety additives, colors etc can be extracted in structured format. The alternative healthy ingredients recommended by FDA / health institutes can be mapped to the normal ingredients. Another module of the application should have capability to extract the data from social media sites to understand the acceptance of the alternate ingredients from various groups of people including doctors, food specialists and common people. These information can be further reviewed by food/nutrition specialist team within Mars. Later these results can be taken to perform research in their food labs to come up with better healthy products. "	NA

As only a fewer choices are offered to customer, he is less confused. Once he finds his choice, it offers recipes with healthier alternatives. Also it asks if customer wants to pick up at local store or online and shows the available stores based on his location.

Recent surveys showed that e-books were among the top purchased items on amazon, next to wellness products like Sleep wristbands  etc.

Majority of the readers like to sip a coffee or eat fries etc, while reading. If there is a healthier substitutes, eg dark chocolates, made available,
any reader would embrace a change to a healthier lifestyle.

On this premise, i would like to propose the idea of 'Chocolate discounts' for each e-book purchases, which will help readers to purchase chocolates via amazon etc.

eg. With purchase of  'The Hobbit (Collins Readers)' , Amazon should 30% discount on $10 Mars Chocolate box, which means i have to pay only $7. 
Readers would love it not because of the discount but would see it as a lifestyle enhancer.

With some social engineering, and with some targeted marketing strategies, i feel this could be a sustainable business model.

"Modernize VSAM based Mainframe system using MEAN stack - MongoDB as storage with a modern web user intertace using Angular JS



Today, the mainframe reservation system of Princess is managed in VSAM flat files with heavy cost for IBM Mainframe computing platform. The MVC proposed is to modernize the platform and take the multiple end systems to web with agility, by converting the back end flat file infrastructure to MongoDB and leveraging MEAN stack to deliver feature rich User interface to both Travel Agents and Direct customers.The data is already in an unstrcutred fashion, so MongoDB fits the purpose. 



In addition to reducing the cost of IBM Mainframes, the new platform should be able to faciliatate an API first approach through Node.js based infrastruture to expose business functions as REST APIs. This should enable to moentize the API and back end infrastructure through Industry parter companies like Expedia etc.

Analysis of Detected cyber-attacks and correlating incidents for Diagnosis the Trends.  
   
Cyber-attacks can be detected through an Open source Intrusion Detection Systems called OSSEC.   
Some of the utilities with OSSEC are File integrity checking, Log analysis, Rootcheck and rootkit detection, time-based alerting & active response and process monitoring.   
OSSEC has the capability to generate alerts for all intrusions that we define even using our customized scripts.   
We can define the intrusions and alert parameters within a JASON file and that helps to collect inputs for destination - Mongo Db where the alert logs get stored.   
One of the key advantages is that MongoDB allows storing alert logs in JASON file formats in spite of the Alerts being in different formats.   
   
Here we are using MongoDb for analyze, co-relate security alerts and finding out the trends and attacking behaviors. With the help of MongoDB Compass we can visualize these analysis results.   
In our use case we have used MongoDB's Content Management and Delivery utilities.    
   
For example We can categorize and compare attacks based on few aspects as below.  
   
1) Attacker’s IP addresses   
   
2) Attacker's Geographical locations (Countries, continents)   
   
3) Type of attacks   
   
4) Techniques used for attacks

"MongoDB, the leading NoSQL database, is a natural fit for the cloud. With its native scale-out architecture, MongoDB enables horizontal scaling through “sharding.” Sharding allows you to automatically distribute data evenly across multi-node clusters and balances queries across them.
Many MongoDB users are running their database deployment in the cloud to take advantage of these benefits. Amazon Web Services (AWS), a MongoDB cloud computing partner, is a popular choice for these users. It’s a great solution for those who require high-performance operations on large datasets.

"Product/Sales Promotion with Real-time Analytics

Benefits
Retail : Set up a digital geo-fence around a shopping mall or business location to push in-store incentives to shoppers in real time.
Technology  : Identify unique individuals across any type of device, browser or app  and use a holistic behavioral model to advertise to them.

Constrains of Real-Time Analytics
Need  to stay constantly update : We need to account for unstructured and  semi-structured data based on user behavior, interests and outlook to  product categories, brands and utility. And new sources of interest  present themselves unpredictably. Relational databases aren’t capable of  handling this, which leaves us searching for an alternative.No  predictable scalebility : We need to analyze terabytes or petabytes of  data. You need immediate response times to make use of the collected  data. That’s a lot more than a single server can handle. Relational  databases weren’t designed for handling unrelational data.Batch  processing :  In many cases,  need to analyze rapidly changing,  multi-structured data in real time. We don’t have the luxury of time or  resource to structure the collected data and use in for analytics later. Batch processes are the right approach for such jobs.
Advantages of MongoDB
Extendibility : MongoDB can handle data in any structure, format or source and handle the changes rapidly. The proposed analytical engines can be comprehensive and real-time.Scalability : MongoDB is built to scale out on commodity hardware, in your data  center or in the cloud without the help of complex hardware or extra software.Real Time  : MongoDB can analyze data of any structure directly within the database,  giving  results in real time, and without expensive data warehouse  loads."

GridFS has the capability to store files even greater than its document size limit of 16MB.
*To store various logs
Capped collections are fixed-size circular collections that follow the insertion order to support high performance for create, read, and delete operations. By circular, it means that when the fixed size allocated to the collection is exhausted, it will start deleting the oldest document in the collection without providing any explicit commands.

"Live experience, personalization etc. are some of the trends predicted for banking sector. Be it credit card points or loyalty points associated with retailers, the potential of these reward system is currently locked and operate in silos. Blockchain would be the ideal choice to unlock it, as there is already an existing blockchain framework, involving banking which can be extended for credit cards as well.

Points that a shopper earn while shopping with credit cards should help him to buy items that are useful for him, eg those that are there in his wishlist, recent searches, etc.
eg Imagine the shopper in a mall, checking the iPhone7 models on display. If he is able to get an intelligent real time message that says 'With the purchase of iPhone7,
you will earn enough points to buy the book added in your wishlist'; This will enable the shopper to use the credit points more effectively.
An integrated comprehensive user profile derived from his financial transactions (from banking application), shopping(retail applications) and online searches, can help AI systems to generate useful real time tips to the user, like the one mentioned above.

A Loan-seeker can choose his repayment tariff.

Lesser the repayment time lesser the interest rate, else will be higher.

if the loan-seeker improves his credit score with the repayment he will be getting respective discounts in the last installment.

If the credit score is extremely impressive then loan-seeker will get option to extend the loan repayment duration 
without any additional charges with current rate of interest."	
Implementing minibots through out the SDLC phase	
Recently we heard a news from Amazon regarding a futuristic shop with no tills or cashiers. Amazon has opened a grocery store in which shoppers only have to scan their smartphone upon entry, with purchases automatically charged to a credit card when they leave the store. The shops use machine vision technology to identify what shoppers take certain items. When something is taken off a shelf, a pressure sensor is activated and cameras in the store identify which shopper has taken the product in question. The pressure sensors will charge people as soon as they are triggered. Why we can't use the same technology in our own house to automatically order groceries ? It would be a hardware unit like a fridge which will monitor grocery purchases make with our credit cards, and buy them for you automatically. The items could even be delivered to your door by Ola or Uber. The purchases are automatically charged to our credit card and hence increasing the card usage.	
"Problem:
In the current credit scoring used by banking and financial companies only a limited amount of data is used. This is heavily weighted toward existing credit history, length of credit usage, and payment history. This results in many qualified customers – or anyone trying to access credit for the first time – being rejected for loans, credit cards and more. There is a big revenue opportunity that is missed by the current credit assessment system.

 Idea/Solution:
	The idea is to create an Artificial Intelligence system to analyze the employment history data, social media data, shopping and purchasing patterns and build a 360-degree view of the credit “opportunity” as opposed to pure risk. The system can provide real-time updates of credit scores based on recent employment status changes or transactions, so that a customer’s credit score is not a fixed number but something that evolves.

We're looking for exceptions that make the business stand out. Its these exceptions and the extraordinary problem solving-skills that make a business rise to the top. Central idea is not just focusing only on routine procedure like meet and greet; everyone does the ordinary ordinarily well. Instead thinking from customer perspective and coming with the solutions for all the end users. 	
"Currently, the financial company's using 'Credit rating' for providing loans. 
we can group customers based on their credit rating, gender, loan repayment history, social information available on the web etc. 
Whenever a new 'Loan' request comes in from a customer we can predict 'loan repayment capacity' by identifying the customer belongs to which group.

example: if a group of customers  (Grouped using AI prediction) having a high credit rating but fails to repay due to some other social reasons. so a loan approver can 'reject' loan request."	
To enhance the customer experience and satisfaction through always available customer support (Chat bot with voice recognition and response)	
This is to predict credit card fraud in the transactional data. Based on the Geo Location, Amount and other attributes system will have an second authentication before processing Credit card pre-authentication based on machine learning. Historical credit card data of the user is used by AI to compare with the current transaction parameters, arriving at two of the possible outcomes – fraud, or genuine. This in turn can be used to alert/stop the transaction before processing. Parameters can be anything from Location, Amount, Time, Merchant, POS, Goods, Service etc .	
We are proposing an idea for Chat Bot which can be used in company’s home page portal. 	
Human and automated service agents collaborate to get things done for the customer and ultimately offer a better customized experience. In other words, a human-assisted virtual agent (HAVA).	
Vehicle loan payment reminder solution is a web based application with GPS vehicle tracking where Provident arrears specialist select a vehicle, enter the account details and add the borrower’s contact information. Then, payment reminders will be sent to the borrower via text or email. You can also schedule a reminder when the ignition is turned on or disable the vehicle’s starter if payment is not received, using GPS locate the vehicle and lock them remotely who have not paid the arrears after reminders.	
To share the current location of the agent to the customer so that the customer can ensure his availability at the time of repayment .	
Microsoft Cortana voice technology can allow customers to pay credit card bills or loan using their voice.

"Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Iris Biometrics Technique 
A new architecture based on Iris Biometric Technique is a very recent concept and it is very useful for decrease Credit Card Frauds over Internet.  This technique is use for the security purpose. 
Credit card companies and Canadian banks are developing biometric authentication technologies to enable customers to validate transactions both in-store and online using biometric identifiers, according to a report by CanadaCreditCards.com

2) ATMs with iris scanners

When taking out cash, you won’t need a plastic card with a magnetic stripe — that’s a nearly 50-year-old technology, by the way — if you’re at a next-generation ATM with an iris scanner. No two humans’ irises are alike, so a scan of the eye is a very accurate way to verify identity.

"An virtual assistant which captures the query by text and voice which will convert the intention of the user by using an Language understanding model which is trained with different queries. Then the intentions are mapped against a knowledge base and the respective solutions are provided back with chat/voice or email. The additional layer of learning which will enable the virtual assistant to make the responses  more precise by taking the feedback from the user for the actions performed.

Challenges :1. Creating the language understanding model which needs lot of training for fine tuning. The initial set of problems to be identified.
2. Creating the knowledge base which will provide the responses back to the end user for  the identified intents and entities"

"Think of a scenario at UST where we are presenting the salient points of a project brief to our team but we are not entirely convinced that they understand the points we are making.

App to induce relevant questions to the team members and also assess their understanding of the subject matter. 

1. Should be able create questions, share them with team members and ask them to respond, all during the course of our information sharing session. Responses can be checked in real time, giving you a very clear idea of whether you are on the right track or there are still some grey areas that need to be addressed. What’s more, you can even share the necessary research/reference material with your team, so that they get a better understanding of what you are talking about.

Teamwork is all about effective communication that keeps all members of the team on the same page. The  app which we are developing should helps you to approach team communication with a lot of confidence; at the end of a meeting, you have no doubts about your team’s understanding of the topic that was under discussion.

"In most workplaces, laptop users have to scan their laptops at the front desk security personnel and they manually check it in via a software after verifying if the person brings in is the same they see on the screen. 
Idea is to automate this process (inspiration from Amazon Go). There needs to be a scanner through which the user can just walk-by. It scans the tag in laptop and the access tag of the user and uses face recognition to verify the identity of the person. So the person has to just walk-in and walk-out while it automatically checks-in and checks-out the laptop. 
The idea is to basically avoid security personnel stopping associates for various checks like, laptop, bag, id tag etc. All those checks can be much more effective if performed digitally. "	
"Our idea is about introducing a chatbot which helps employees to clear any doubts regarding office procedures. it is basically a mobile app to which employees can ask questions.

"DIIPA -s Digital interactive and Intelligent  assistant  is a Cloud hosted Product (APP)  who can interact both with VOICE and TEXT ,who mainly help to improve the processes  like  VISA  Document processing  ,Document verification and Classification , New Joinee document  processing, Verification  , Pay roll related document processing  & Verification , Recruitment Processing ,  Pre sales document processing  & verification like Proposal  for clients  through Machine learning  and Artificial  intelligence ., Data Mining ,Classification Algorithms 

I would like to describe my idea with an example – VISA processing & VISA Interview processing 

For VISA processing there are number document verification and classification doing before submitting  the CASE to Attorney   , now a days this is completely manual work .

DIIPA uses Artificial intelligence and  Machine learning , Classification Algorithms , Data mining  ,Cloud computing  , make it  as a  e- processing for document verification and classification based on feature selection and Custom Rule Engine . Once it verified upload it in Cloud environment with digital secure hash key .

We can also apply the concepts of Block chain for Digital identity for ""Know your employee /Customer"" .The digital identify available  centrally for  HR, Attorney ,USCIS ,Other companies , Govt  for any kind of employment verification ,background verification .and they can update as well , they need to get secure hash key which needs to provided by User/employee

DIPPA will communicate with User – 

1.	Provide the UST guidelines  , USICS guidelines and Documents templates for VISA processing & Interview 
2.	Clarify the questions of the user 
3.	Gather all documents required for VISA processing & Interview  from user – then  verify , classify based on machine learning ,Data mining and Classification algorithms    and  Once it verifies , it  upload the documents on could environment and provide an email communication to both User and Attorney .And User will get a hash key through secure email.
4.	 Attorney can verify the documents and submit. for further processing with USICS 

Future Enhancement with Govt policies (VISION)-Next step

1. No documents needs to be carried for VISA interview and Port of entry , just the digital hash key.
2. Consulate /USCIS /Port of entry uses the hash key and retrieve the details  from cloud and verified and update the VISA status ,I-94 date  to digital identify
3 We can also configure email on this app to get email alerts for VISA expiry.I-94 date expiry

For a large organisation each employee ID is considered to be a BOT. Bot is a dump worker, they have the basic properties of various department functionalities like HR , finance, service, project management  and their roles. Bot also contains a hierarchical mechanism to control other bots via  masters and a slaves functionalities. Basic work flow can be controlled here . Various hierarchies having different specific tasks whose workflow differ according to the function can be grouped here. All the bots will work together in an * intelligent working environment. So each bot will have the basic functionalities of  encapsulation , inheritance, delegation ,dynamic dispatch.The bot's workflow maybe assigned or triggered by the other bots or other virtual environments. Intelligent working environment will be able to provide messaging facilities like one-to one one-to-many , many-to-one , broadcasting. The intelligent working environment will be able to work like a social network or like email .	
"Every employees are facing big problems while parking vehicle and it is very tough for them to remember were he/she is parked his/her vehicle while returning at the evening, for this problem we will provide NFC(Near Field communication) to all vehicle user ""It is a set of communication protocols that enable two electronic devices, one of which is usually a portable device such as a smart-phone, to establish communication by bringing them within 4 cm (1.6 in) of each other"", Our idea attach their NFC, back of user ID card itself. So it easy for them to carry with their ID.
By keeping NFC before entering into our parking it will show which row you want to park for this we need to analyze whether the parking row is full or not. By using sensor or by Artificial Intelligence with video Analytics, we can identified whether row is full or not."
